##Grains Lab

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write a program that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains


###For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

Then please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this
experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?


###How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\grains
.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


###Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
